Integrations
============

Psiturk
-------
These experiments are intended to run via the [psiturk infrastructure](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk), and the [experiment factory battery](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-battery) is the main experiment code that, when fit with [experiments](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments), can run on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Cognitive Atlas
---------------
Each experiment (task) is defined in the Cognitive Atlas, as are the cognitive concepts that the experiment measures. This means that, as more experiments are generated, a user can generate a battery intended to measure one or more cognitive concepts of interest.

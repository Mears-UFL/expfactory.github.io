======================

This infrastructure is an effort to standardize, and organize experiments that cna be run on multiple infrastructures. Currently supported is generating experiments in a battery intended to run with `psiturk <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk>`_. on Amazon Mechanical Turk. These repos store, document, and deploy these experiments, and github is used to allow for open contribution from the larger community. `Psiturk-python <http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-python>_` is the controller for this infrastructure, and this documentation will guide usage of the tools:
